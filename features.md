I want to see what project a consultant has worked on for each day of a month, aka their timesheet for that month
I want to set the project for a consultant and a day, aka change the timesheet
I want to see the number of days allocated to each project within a month
I want to set a project for a consultant for a whole month
I want to see if each day of a month has a project set for a consultant, aka if their timesheet is complete for a month
I want only consultants to be able to see their timesheet
I want managers to also be able to see their consultant's timesheets
I want only consultants to be able to change their timesheets
I want to prevent further changes to a consultant timesheet for a month, aka to lock the timesheet
I want to prevent locking a timesheet if it is not complete
I want users to have to authenticate to see anything
I want bad requests to be described in a human readable way, in the language specified by the request
